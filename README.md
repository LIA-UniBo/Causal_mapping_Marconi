# Causal_mapping_Marconi
Code for the generation of causal maps for Marconi100, by using the model of the paper ["Causal Discovery with Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks"](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-4990/1/1/19).
# How to run it?
Run the file `main_marconi.py` in order to generate the map of the input node (change the variable node in the code, for using different nodes).
# Results
The final graphs are put in the directory `results` and they can be shown using the application [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/).
# Example of final results:
